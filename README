SGDemoApp

================================================================================
ABSTRACT:

This is a sample application that shows off many of the different components
within the SGiPhoneSDK. The SGLocationService is used to load records from multiple
global layers into CoreData. The records are then displayed in three different 
avenues: UITableView, SGLayerMapView and SGARNavigationViewController.

GeoJSON objects that are retrieved from SimpleGeo require different interpretations
depending on which layer they were acquired from. Instead of storing the GeoJSON
objects as NSDictionaries, 6 subclasses of SGManagedRecord are provided to help
ease the differentation processes. None of these records are saved when the
application exits; they are only stored for the duration of the app.

Both the UITableView and SGARNavigationViewController will only display those
records that are within 1km radius of the devices current location. The AR
enviornment is set to one of the standard styles. The map will load and display 
records based on the displayed region of the view. When the map retrieves 
records from SimpleGeo, they are inserted into CoreData for future retrieval.

PACKAGING LIST:

Model
Contains all of the data models.

    Layers
    Contains the single subclass of SGLayer used for all SGManagedRecords.
    
        SGSpecificLayer
        This is a subclass of SGLayer. It is initialized with the name of the lyaer
        and the subclass of SGManagedRecord. It needs a subclass of SGManagedRecord
        because the layer needs to know how to build SGManagedRecords from incoming
        GeoJSON NSDictionaries.
        
    Records
    Contains all subclasses of SGManagedRecord.
    
        SGSocialRecord
        A subclass of SGManagedRecord. Since there are some commonalities between
        the user-defined properties for a Brightkite, Tweet and Flickr, it made
        sense to create another abstraction layer. This type of record holds onto
        properties such as profile image and profile image, absolute URL.
        
        SGBrightkite
        A subclass of SGSocialRecord that interprets the Brightkite GeoJSON encoded
        object recieved from SimpleGeo into a managable CoreData entity.
        
        SGFlickr
        A subclass of SGSocialRecord that interprets the Flickr GeoJSON encoded
        object recieved from SimpleGeo into a managable CoreData entity.
        
        SGTweet
        A subclass of SGSocialRecord that interprets the Tweet GeoJSON encoded
        object recieved from SimpleGeo into a managable CoreData entity.
        
        SGUSZip
        A subclass of SGSocialRecord that interprets the USZip GeoJSON encoded
        object recieved from SimpleGeo into a managable CoreData entity.        
        
        SGUSWeather
        A subclass of SGSocialRecord that interprets the USWeather GeoJSON encoded
        object recieved from SimpleGeo into a managable CoreData entity.
        
        SGGeoNames
        A subclass of SGSocialRecord that interprets the GeoNames GeoJSON encoded
        object recieved from SimpleGeo into a managable CoreData entity.
        
    
TableCells
Contains all subclasses of UITableViewCell.
    
    SGSocialRecordTableCell
    Displays a SGSocialRecord in a UITableView.
    
SGAdditions
Contains all categories.
    
    SGManagedRecordAdditions
    Adds a few CoreData query methods to help with population control.
    
Controllers
Contains all subclasses of UIViewController.

    SGMainViewController
    The main view controller which implements a total of 7 protocols. All actions
    take place within this view controller.
    
    SGWebViewController
    A simple view controller that loads a URL into a webview.
    
Views
    SGPinAnotationView
    A simple map annotation view that will update its accessory views when it
    is asked to layout its subviews.
    
    
LocationDemoAppDelegate
The application delegate who is incharge of initializing the CoreData components.
